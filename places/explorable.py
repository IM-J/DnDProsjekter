#like towns, but with dungeons, towers, forrests, caves. should include rooms, enemies, treasures, levels up or down etc

#Dungeons should have lower levels and be beneath houses, castles and inside caves. maybe even under a tree.

#Towers, like wizard towers, could be a fun adventure. Stealing from an evil wizard. Like finding a king trapped in a snowglobe. Choosing weather to save or kill them.

#Forrests are different, as here it is a matter of ruins and enemies and animals. Maybe even highway robbers.
